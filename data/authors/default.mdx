I'm Mehdi, a software engineer who got hooked on coding in 1998 with a C program and never looked back. Since then I've built full-stack applications, contributed to core open-source infrastructure, and worked on systems where correctness and performance aren't optional.

Most recently I built **[MonitorMe](https://github.com/mehdiakiki/monitorme)**, an open-source observability tool, and engineered a low-latency trading platform at Attijariwafa Bank. I work across the full stack: React, Next.js, and TypeScript on the front end; Python, Go, Rust, and Java on the back, but my instinct is always toward the underlying system, not just the surface.

I've contributed to **[Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust)**, **[Rust Analyzer](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-analyzer)**, **[Deno](https://github.com/denoland/deno)**, and **[Mozilla](https://github.com/nickel-org/nickel.rs)** with the kind of codebases where a single PR requires understanding architecture at depth.

### Open Source

**Selected OSS Contributions**

**[Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust)** · **[Rust Analyzer](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-analyzer)** · **[Deno](https://github.com/denoland/deno)** · **[Mozilla](https://github.com/nickel-org/nickel.rs)**

### Opportunities

I'm open to full-time roles and select contracts. I do my best work on hard problems; performance-critical systems, financial infrastructure, developer tooling. Freelance clients: if the technical bar is high and you need someone to own it end-to-end, let's talk.

**[Book a 30-min call](https://cal.com/mehdicz/30min)** or **[email me directly](mailto:hello@mehdi.cz)** if you'd rather start there.
